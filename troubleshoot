Networking s Security Scenarios 
======================
1. A website running on your Linux server is inaccessible, but the server is up. How do you troubleshoot?

We first check if the web server (Apache/Nginx) is running using systemctl status.
Then we verify the firewall rules and use netstat -tuln or ss -tuln to confirm the port is open.
Finally, we check the server logs (/var/log/) and try curl localhost for local accessibility.

2. You need to allow only a specific IP to access a server over SSH. How would you configure it?

We edit the SSH configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and use AllowUsers or Match blocks.
Alternatively, we use firewall rules: iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <IP> --dport 22 -j ACCEPT.
Don’t forget to restart sshd after changes.

3. Your server is under a DDoS attack. How do you mitigate it using Linux commands?

We can use netstat or ss to identify unusual connections.
Then, we use iptables or firewalld to block IPs or rate-limit traffic.
Installing tools like fail2ban or ufw can help with automated blocking.

4. You need to check which ports are open and which services are listening. How do you do that?

We use ss -tuln or netstat -tuln to view listening ports.
To map services with PIDs, we use ss -tulnp or lsof -i.
This helps identify unauthorized or unexpected services.

5. A user is unable to reach an external website from a Linux server. How do you troubleshoot network connectivity?

We first check basic connectivity with ping or curl.
Then we verify DNS resolution using dig or nslookup.
If needed, we check routes with ip route and firewall settings with iptables or ufw.

6. You need to set up a firewall to allow only HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic. How do you do it?

Using ufw, we run:
ufw allow 22 
ufw allow 80 
ufw allow 443 
ufw enable 
For iptables, we allow specific ports and drop the rest.

7. How do you check which process is using a specific port?

We use lsof -i :<port> or ss -tulnp | grep <port> to find the PID and program.
It tells us which service is bound to the port.
This is useful for troubleshooting conflicts or security risks.

8. A connection to a database is failing from your Linux server. How do you troubleshoot it?

We first check connectivity with telnet <host> <port> or nc.
Then we confirm the database service is up and accepting connections.
Firewall, SELinux, or bind-address misconfigurations can also block access.

9. You need to change the default SSH port for security reasons. How do you do it?

We edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change the Port directive to a new number.
Then, we allow the new port in the firewall and restart the SSH service.
It’s good practice to inform users and test before closing the old port.

10. How do you enable IP forwarding on a Linux system?

We temporarily enable it with:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
For a permanent setup, we edit /etc/sysctl.conf and set net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1, then run sysctl -p.
